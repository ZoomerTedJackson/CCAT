Simple script to detect Google Chromecasts on your network and then jam them by sending infinite, continuous requests to display something. 

Practically forces a blank screen until you unplug the device. 

Plans were had to see if any other cool "exploits" were possible but then that never happened, so this is a "toolkit" with one tool and its barely a tool.

***This was written just after the first generation Chromecast was released and then it was never updated. This surely doesn't work anymore.***
